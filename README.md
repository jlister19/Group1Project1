Description/Outline:

We seek to explore the effect of COVID-19 on levels of crime in Chicago, Illinois, particularly as it has affected domestic violence. 
We are interested in how domestic violence numbers from the pandemic have compared to pre-pandemic levels, and especially if there was an increase in domestic violence during the earliest phase of the Restore Illinois plan. 
In addition, we are interested to know how socioeconomic status affected levels of domestic violence crimes in specific areas of Chicago and if a large difference was noted during specific time periods immediately proceeding lockdown, during lockdown, and immediately following lockdown.

Question to Answer:

1) How has COVID impacted domestic violence rates in Chicago?

2) Which communities have been the most impacted by any change?

3) How did rates during the lockdown compare to rates immediately preceeding and immediately following lockdown?
