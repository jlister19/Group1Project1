Team Members:

Victor

Description/Outline:

We seek to explore the effect of COVID-19 on levels of crime in Cook County, Illinois, particularly as it has affected domestic violence. 
We are interested in how domestic violence numbers from the pandemic have compared to pre-pandemic levels, and especially if there was an increase in domestic violence during the earlier phases of the Restore Illinois plan. 
In addition, we are interested to know how socioeconomic status affected levels of domestic violence crimes in specific areas of Cook County and if a large difference was noted during specific time periods since March 2020.

Question to Answer:

1) How has COVID impacted Dom violence rates in Cook County?

2) Which communities have been the most impacted by this?

3) How did rates during the quarantine compare to rates when we weren't in lockdown?
